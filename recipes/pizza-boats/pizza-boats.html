            Friday night often is pizza and salad night at our house, and dinner prep for these pizza boats doesnâ€™t get much easier. Each roll half can be customized to keep everybody happy, so allow them to choose their favorite toppings. One time it may be pepperoni and tomatoes, then next time might be sausage, onions, meatballs, roasted peppers, olives, or bacon.

        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>

        </h3>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a piece of aluminum foil on a baking sheet; set aside.</li>
        <li>Slice each hoagie roll in half lengthwise to form two rolls, and using your fingertips, hollow out some of the bread inside, forming a well. Lightly brush each roll with olive oil, and sprinkle with Italian seasoning.

        </li>
        <li>Fill and spread each roll with 1/4 cup pizza sauce and then top with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Layer pepperoni and grape tomatoes on top of the cheese, sprinkle with red pepper flakes, and season to taste with salt. Place rolls on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is turning golden brown and starting to bubble, 12 to 14 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
